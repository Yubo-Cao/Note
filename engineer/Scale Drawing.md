# Scaling
- **Scaling** is the process by which a real, life-sized object can be represented on a peice of paper or a computer screen by **proportionally** decreasing or increaseing the size of the object.
- **Scale Factor**
	- Ratio form: `1:24`, `1 to 24`
	- Fraction form: `1/24` 
		- First number is associated with **representation**, i.e., drawing
		- Second number associated with **real life object**.
		- For example, in `1:24` drawing, if drawing is 1 inch, then real life is 24 inch
- **Relationship**
	- If scale down, first number in ratio is smaller
	- If scale up, the first number in the ratio is larger
- **Properties**
	- When a scale factor has been applied, lengths in the graph change, but the angles remain the same
		- The quantative relation between corresponding sides is a ratio.
		- Correspondig angles are not scaled and remain unchanged

- **Units and Scale**
	- Notice that scale may not always be same units, at representation and real objects side.
		- `1/8'' = 1 Foot` stand for that each 0.125 inch is 1 foot, which shall be converted to `1:96`.
- **Coordinate Scaling**
	- If scale up, times the scale factor; otherwise, divide by the scale factor.
	- If reference point is specified, scale the triangle that formed from reference point to point on the object, i.e., tranformation, to above step, and transform it back.

	- Example questions
		- Scale up $\triangle_{ABC}$ by factor of 3, points are

| Points | X   | Y   |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| A      | 0   | 0   |
| B      | 4   | 0   |
| C      | 0   | 3   |

Then the scaled version is just, which is obtained through convert it scale factor to 3:1, and times each coordinate with that.
| Points | X   | Y   |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| A      | 0   | 0   |
| B      | 12  | 0   | 
| C      | 0    | 9    |

- Similarly, if scale down is desired, then convert it to 1:3
