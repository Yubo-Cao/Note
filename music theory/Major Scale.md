# Major Scale
[[Foundation]]
## Terminology
- Whole step
	- If there are two half steps, then there is a whole step.
	- For example, C => D is a whole step
- Half step
	- From white key to black key, e.g., C => C#
	- From white key to an adjacent white key which does not have a black key in between, e.g., E => F

## Construction
- WWHWWWH
	- W: Whole step
	- H: Half step
- With this in mind, we are able to construct any major scale on the piano.
	- Start with C#, then
		- C# D# E# F# G# A# B# C#
		- ![[Pasted image 20220601173718.png]]
	- Start with E, then
		- E F# G# A B C# D# E
## Flats and Sharps
- Flat
	- Lower a note by a half step
- Sharp
	- Raise a note by a half step
- Example
	- F# exists
	- Fb become E
## Major 2nd & Major 3rd
- Major 2nd
	- Two half steps
- Major 3rd
	- Four half steps
	- Therefore, it does not always mean the difference between two scale degrees of C major. 
		- It is necessary to put lower one of them as root of a major scale, and then use that to determine
		- e.g., F to E. E major scale is E F# G# A B C# D# E. Notice F is not on this major scale, therefore, it is neither
## Tonal Center
- The predominant tone that we hear when we are playing a progression or a song.
	- It is ground zero.
	- The anchor note that is played or that's heard.
	- Everything gravitates back to tonal center.
	- Tonal center is also defined, as the tonic Do of the scale, tonic, or key, or scale degree 1
	- The key that seems to fits every chord, and it is tonal center.
- It can also be found from sharps and flats
	- Go up a half step from the last sharps (remember, the order of sharps, every notes is a sharp!)
	- For order flats, the second last one is the key
# Perfect 4th and Perfect 5th
- Perfect 4th
	- 7 half steps
- Perfect 5th
	- 9 half steps
