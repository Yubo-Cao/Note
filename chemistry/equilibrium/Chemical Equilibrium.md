# Intro
- Equilibrium is a state of balance
- Static equilibrium
    - Tug of war
- Dynamic equilibria
    - Forward process and the reverse process take place at the same rate, so no net change occurs/observes
    - Water analogy
        - You use plastic bottle to get rid of water from thy boat
        - Water filled into thy boat through a hole
        - Eventually, not net change happens due to that you can't fill your plastic bottle, and water height stabilized
    - Vapor pressure
        - In close container
        - The pressure of vapor stabilized when the rate of molecules escaping from the liquid to gas `==` the rate which molecules from gas phases reenter the liquid
- Negligence
    - Like solubility, if the reverse reaction of the chemical reaction is sufficiently slow, we neglect it as it does not exists.
    - However, sometimes, it does not work out:
        - **Chemical equilibrium** occurs when the forward and reverse reactions proceed at equal rates.
            - `Product -> Reactants == Reactants -> Product`
            - **Concentration stabilized**
# Concept of Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium state**, a mixture of reactants and products whose concentrations no longer change with time.
- **Equilibrium mixture**, a mixture that reaches *eqilibrium state*.
- ![[Pasted image 20220517204221.png]]
    - $\ce{N2O4(g) <=>[\Delta] 2NO2(g)}$
    - As the above system is in a closed system, the equilibrium mixture can be maintained over time.
	- It creates an equilibrium mixture, because the reaction is reversible.
	- Both reactions from left to right and from right to left, are *elementary reactions*.
		- Rate forward = $\ce{k_f[N2O4]}$
		- Rate backward = $\ce{k_r[NO2]^2}$
		- As their rate evntually equals, their ratio become a constant, or *equilibrium constant*
		- Notice that the rate of reaction is equal, but **it does not imply that concentration/$\ce{k_f}$/$\ce{k_r}$** are equal.
- The equilibrium presented above is *dynamic*, i.e., some $\ce{N2O4}$ is always converting to $\ce{NO2}$, and vice versa.
# Equilibrium Constant

# Le Chatelier's Principle
> If a system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in temperature, pressure, or a component concentration(stress), the system will shift its equilibrium position so as to counteract the effect of the disturbance.
- **Concentration**: Adding or removing a reactant or product
	- If a substance is added to a system at equilibrium, the system reacts to consume some of the substance. If a substance is removed from a system, the system reacts to produce more of substance.
- **Pressure**: Changing the pressure by changing the volume
	- At constant temperature, reducing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium mixture causes the system to shift in the direction that reduces the number of moles of gas
- **Temperature**: Changing the temperature
	- If the temperature of a system at equilibrium is increased, the system reacts if we added a reactant to an endothermic reaction, or a product to an exothermic reaction (essentially, reduce the temperature by reverse the exothermic/do endothermic)
	- The equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes the excess reagents, i.e., heat.
## Concentration
- The equilibrium **shift** until a new state of balance is attained.
	- Equilibrium constant is self kept same
	- The new situation is accomdated by the syste.
- Haber's reaction
	- By continuously removing $\ce{NH3}$ that is produced, we are able to make $\ce{H2, N2}$ continuously
		- Utilizing the physical properties of $\ce{NH3}$ -- higher boiling point than $\ce{N2}$ and $\ce{H2}$, which makes cooling gas and extract liquified ammonia feasible.
### Volume and Pressure Changes
- If system containing one or more gases is at equilibrium and it volume is decreased, and thus, increase its pressure, the system responds as to reduce the pressure.
	- Essentially, favor the product/reactant that would reducing total number of gas molecules.
	- **Reducing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium mixture causes the system to shift in the directon that reduces the number of moles of gas**, and vice versa.
- Notice that it is possible that change the pressure, without change the volume, i.e., add more gas molecules even if not relevant. In that case, no shift in equilibrium would be observed, as partial pressure does not change.
### Effect of Temperature Changes
- Change in concentration of pressure does not involve change in equilibrium constant.
- Temperature changes almost always change equilibrium constant.
### Catalyst
- The catalyst increases the rate at which the equilibrium is achieved, but it does not change the composition of equilibrium mixture.
