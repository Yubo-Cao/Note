# Type

- There are two type of malware.
  - First need a **host program**, that is, they have to be embedded in the host program in order to run and spread
  - second is **independent**, meaning that they themselves are independent programs that can run by themselves

## Hosted

### Trap doors

- Also known as back doors
- **Secret entry point** to the program or system, e.g., recognizing **special input** command that only programmer/attacker know
  - **Special sequence of input**
  - **Special user ID**

### Logic bombs

- Trigger planted in a program.
- Embedded in some **legitimate program**
- **Explode** when triggering condition is met:
  - **Certain date**

### Trojan horses

- hidden in an apparently useful host program.
- **Embedded** in a utility program that user will run frequently, simultaneously, the malicious code execute multithreaded/sub process.
  - It still does primary function
  - Malicious purpose is fulfilled in background
- Example
  - Login program that performs key logging
    - User can log in
    - Simultaneously, password and username is passed to internet server.

### Viruses

- Infect a program by **modifying** it
- **Self-copy** into the program to spread
  - Virus code run first, then main code is executed.
- Find other programs it can infect, and therefore, spread itself.
- Structure of infected program
  - ![[Pasted image 20220522173057.png]]
  - The virus program run first
  - It also puts marker in the program, so it does not infect same file multiple times
  - Main procedure:
    - Find uninfected program and infect them, by checking whether the special flag has been putted.
    - Perform malicious actions
      - Stealing valuable documents
      - Weird actions
    - transfer the control back to original program

### Malicious browser plugins, extensions, and scripts.

## Independent Malware

Independent malware does not need a host program. These are complete program by themselves.

### Worms

- Use network connections to spread from system to system
- Major advance in malware in 1990s coinciding with the rapid expansion of internet

### Botnet

- 2005

#### Bot -- Zombie

- A compromised computer under the control of an attacker
- Bot code on the computer communicate with the attacker
- s server and carries out malicious activities per attacker's instructions

#### Botnet

- A network of bots controlled by an attacker to perform coordinated malicious activities
- Key platform for most **internet based attacks**

# Antivirus

### Adware

- Created to serve advertisements to the user's computer
  - Pop-ups
  - Redirect
  - Hyperlinks
  - Ads in weird places
- Software get avenue through clicks
- It may also act as spy ware to steal personal information
- **Signature based detection**

### Bots

- Do the same thing that its owner has instructed
  - to Perform DDoS attack
  - Click on advertisement to create benefits
  - Other purposes, e.g., indexing websites
- Catch
  - Analyze the behavior of all program
  - When repetitive behavior detected, it stops it
  - Captcha detects it and stops it

### Ransomware

- Encrypts the user's personal or confidential information with strong encryption methods
- Must be paid through Bitcoins to decrypt
- **Behavioral analysis**
  - **Sandbox** to analyze the behavior of the program

### Rootkits

- Provide remote access to computer without getting detected
  - Modify settings
  - alter software
  - Executing EXE
  - Steal data
  - Install other malware
- Difficult to detect
- Behavioral analysis and signature database. Combine those two together.

### Spyware

- Record browsing history, search history, financial information, etc. It may also collect credit card passwords
- Send those information to the remote owner
- **Signature + Behavioral + Monitor Internet connection**

### Trojan horse

- Enter the user computer as an useful program
- Give remote access to hacker, download other malware, give remote access to it
- **Heuristic analysis** and **sandbox**

### Virus

- Copy itself and spread to other computers. Attach itself to the other files.
- Delete and corrupt system files.
- **Signature database and behavior analysis**

### Worms

- Use internet to spread, without user intervention.
- Overload bandwidth.
- Filter network monitor.

# Different Social Engineering

- Hacker tricks user to believe that hackers are governmental officials, seniors, or trustworthy persons
- Then they steal the confidential information by using fake website, tricking them to give out confidential information.

## Common types

### Phishing

- Generic email that targets large group of people.

### Spear Phishing Specific Person

- A personalized attack that targets specific person, organization, or business.
- Getting their login information and or install malware.
- Procedure
  - Identifying people -- manager, high position
  - collecting information -- friends, family, social media, and coworkers. Make a profile
  - Crafting attack -- using the information researched. Sense of agency, fear, or curiosity.
  - Stealing data -- if user fell to the trap, then they are redirected to fake website or infect the computer with malware. Then information is got

### Whaling - High profile individuals
### Smishing - Use SMS to phishing
- Originates from email based phishing attacks
- 98% of text is read and responded. Therefore, text message exploits the more intimate relationship between user and phone.
	- This is more effective
- Types
	- Give up confidential information
	- Downloading malware
	- Trick you into sending someone money, e.g., pay money in order to get some price.
	- Generosity, e.g., charity organization.
## Prevention

- Awareness
	- Be aware of such attacks
	- Training about this kind of attacks
		- Rules that prevents user from entering confidential information into unfamiliar websites.
		- Chains of communication, from lower level to upper level.
- Protecting privacy
	- Review privacy settings
	- Clean friend list
	- Reduce the amount of friends
	- Limit sharing publicly
	- Do not share
		- Full name
		- Corporate email
		- Designation
		- Date of birth
- Security
	- Anti-virus
	- Updates
