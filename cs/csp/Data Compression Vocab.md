| Vocab                      | Definition                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binary Tree**            | a data structure that can, at the most, have two nodes or “branches”                                                        |
| **Bit Depth**              | refers to the amplitude of the analog wave and specifically to the number of bits used for each sample                      |
| **Codec**                  | a computer program that encodes or decodes                                                                                  |
| **Dictionary**             | a key in metadata explaining the instructions to encode/decode compressed data                                              |
| **Discarding Data**        | a type of lossy compression that removes unneeded data with no way to get that data back                                    |
| **Fixed-length Code**      | blocks of code that are always the same size                                                                                |
| **Huffman Tree**           | a prefix free binary tree that is the most efficient way to compress individual characters                                  |
| **Interframe Compression** | a video compression that **re-uses redundant pixels** from one frame to the next, also known as **temporal** compression    |
| **Intraframe Compression** | a technique used by **compressing each frame of a video**, also known as **spatial** compression                            |
| **Lossless**               | data compression that does not lose data during compression                                                                 |
| **Lossy**                  | data compression that loses data during compression                                                                         |
| **Metadata**               | additional data about the main data, usually at the beginning of a file                                                     |
| **Prefix-Free Code**       | a specific type of variable-length code that does not use pauses                                                            |
| **Psychoacoustics**        | a sub-branch of psychophysics that deals specifically with sound                                                            |
| **Psychophysics**          | a branch of psychology that focuses on the fact that the human eye or ear will not be able to detect a certain loss of data |
| **Redundancy**             | finding frequencies or patterns in code                                                                                     |
| **Run-Length Encoding**    | looking for redundancy or patterns as runs in the code                                                                      |
| **Sample Rate**            | how often an analog signal is used when converting to digital, usually measured in kHz                                      |
| **Uncompressed**           | all the information from an original file in the same format                                                                |
| **Variable-Length Code**   | all representations of data blocks can be different lengths                                                                 |
