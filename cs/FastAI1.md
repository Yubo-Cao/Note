### PDP

- A set of **processing unit**
- A **state of activation**
- An **output function** for each unit
- A **pattern of connectivity** among units
- A **propagation rule** for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectives
- An **activation rule** for combing the inputs impinging on a unit with the current sate of that unit to produce an output for the unit
- A **learning rule** whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience
- An **environment** within which the system must operate

Get practical, good performance you need to use even more layers of neurons

### Setup

I will stuck with gradient.

```python
#id first_training
#caption Results from the first training
# CLICK ME
from fastai.vision.all import *
path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'

def is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(
    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,
    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(1)
```

### General Idea

- The idea of a “weight assignment”
- The fact that every weight assignment has some “actual performance”
- The requirement that there be an “automatic means” of testing that performance
- The need for a “mechanism” (i.e., another automatic process) for improving the performance by changing the weight assignments

- Parameters, also known as weight. They constitutes another kind of input that a program will take.
  - Those parameters will be adjusted automatically based on performance while we training the model -- *learn from experience*
- When we use the mode, the parameters are integrated into model, and it only take inputs and yield results.
  - *a trained model can be treated just like a regular computer program.*
  - **machine learning** refers to activities to let computer learn from its experience, rather than through manually coding the individual steps.

#### Weight Assignment

- A grade checker can be easily abstracted to inputs and outputs and feed into a function. However, image, natural language, etc. are more difficult. 
- **Neutral network** is a kind of function that would handle those difficult tasks.
  - **Universal approximation theorem** shows that this function would approximate any input to any accuracy.
  - **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** would handle automatic parameter adjustment for that kind of neural net.

#### Jargon and modern model

- Model $\Longleftrightarrow$ architecture, both refer to the functional form of the model.
- Weights $\Longrightarrow$ parameters 
- Predications $\Longrightarrow$ results, which calculated or data set without label(independent variable)
- Measure of performance $\Longrightarrow$ loss. This also depends on correct labels.

#### Caveats

- Mode need data, especially, **labelled data**
- Model can learn to operate only on patterns that input data contains.
- Only create **predictions**, not recommended **actions**
