Hello everyone,

Today is 2022-7-20 and the next CyberPatriot competition is coming up soon. Thanks to
Bibek's remainder about that, we would like to ask everyone to working on scripting for
The purpose of this competition.

The goal here is to discuss and reach unanimity on the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What scripting langauge should we use? (e.g., Python, Bash, Perl, Awk, Sed, etc.)
    \item What area should we focus on? (e.g., firewall, services, user-management, etc.)
    \item Where do we want to work? (e.g., github, gitlab, or even google drive etc.)
    \item What development environemnt do we want to use? (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04,
          CyberPatriot builded Ubuntu, etc.)
\end{itemize}

After that has been decided, we would like to identify and assign works to our team
memebers.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
