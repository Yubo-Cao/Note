# Biology
- Biology is the scientific study of life.
## Themes of Biology
### Evolution
- As the result of evolution through natural selection over long periods of time, the fur colors of these two populations of mice resemble their surroundings, providing protection from predators
### Organization
- Structure fits function at all levels of a mouse's organization.
#### New Properties *Emerge* at Successive Levels of Biological Organization
- Levels of Biological Organization
	- Biosphere
	  - Consists of all life on Earth and all the places where life exists
	  - Most regions of land, most bodies of water, the atmosphere to an altitude of several kilometers, and sediments far below the ocean floor
	- Ecosystems
	  - Consists of all living things in a **particular area**, along with all the **nonliving** components of the environment with which the life interacts, e.g., soil, water, atmospheric gases, and light
	- Communities
	  - The array of organisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem is called a **biological community**, e.g., deer, animals, fungi, etc. 
	  - Each of those forms of life are **species**, a group whose members can only reproduce with other members of the group
	- Populations
	  - A **population** consists of all the individuals of a species living within the bounds of a specified area that interbreed with each other.
	- Organisms
	  - Individual living things are called organisms.
	- Organs
	  - A body part of an organisms, which made up of multiple tissues and has **specific** functions in the body.
	  - For plants, leaves, stems, and roots are organs.
	  - Tissues in organ contributes particular properties to organ function.
	- Tissues
	  - 
- *Reductionism*
	- Reduces the complex systems to simpler components that are more manageable to study.

##### Emergent Properties

- Start from molecule level and zooming out to higher level of system.
  - See novel properties emerge at each level that are absent from the preceding one.
  - This property exists, because arrangement and interactions of parts is also crucial, e.g., chlorophyll molecules mixed in test tube won't work, unless they are in chloroplast.

### Information
- Genetic information encoded in DNS determines a mouse's fur colors.
### Energy and Matter
- Energy flows one way from the sun to plants to a mouse. 
- Matter cycles between a mouse and its environments.
### Interaction
- A plant being eaten by a mouse and a mouse being preyed upon by a hawk are **interactions** with in a system
## Properties of life
- Ordered structure
	- 向日葵的花蕊是圆盘状，规则的生长的
- Evolutionary adaptation
	- Adaptations evolve over countless generations by the reproductive success of those individuals with inheritable traits that are best suited to their environments
- Regulation
	- Jackrabbits 血液循环控制体温
- Energy processing
	- 食物变成化学能，用于飞行、工作、以及捕猎
- Growth and development
	- 基因遗传的信息控制生物生长的状态
- Response to the environment
	- Venus flytrap (捕蝇草) 捕获苍蝇。此处，苍蝇作为 environmental stimulus 出现
- Reproduction
	- 生物可以繁衍
