1. a. The coat colour of a mouse, the amount of moon light, and colour of soil (specifically, the colours reflects the **contrast of colour between mouse and its surroundings**)
   b. The number of mice caught, which reflects the rate of night time predation by owls
2. a. 19 b. 13 c. more likely to escape predation by owls on dark-coloured soil. As data suggested, it lowers the ate which the owl predate it. In addition, it also acts as an camouflage, as hypothesis in previous pages suggested.
3. Under full moon. Under no moon, as there are less amount of mice caught with light coat in light coloured soil in no moon condition, compared to light-coloured soil, mice and full moon.
4. a. Full moon at dark coloured soil. b. No moon at lighted coloured soil.
5. a. Dark coated mice and no moon. b. Light coated mice and full moon.
6. Light coated mice: under full moon at dark coloured soil.
   Dark coated mice: under no moon at light coloured soil.
7. In moon lights: 78. Without moon light: 81. It is slightly better for owl at no moon light condition. It is almost same.
